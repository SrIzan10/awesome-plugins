# sern Plugins

A list of plugins made by the community, for the community.

### How to install

As easy as running `sern plugins` with the [CLI](https://github.com/sern-handler/cli).

You can also install them by downloading the file into your project.

Then, read the comments of the plugin file to know how to use them or run `/plugin` on the discord server

### Contributing

Create your plugin by reading the docs, then open a PR.
Code it in typescript, and a GitHub Action will convert the plugin to JavaScript automatically.
